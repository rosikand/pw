Hey, I'm Rohan! I'm a student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">The Farm</a> studying Computer Science concentrating in Artificial Intelligence. This is my personal home page where I keep a portfolio of my <a href="research.html">research</a>, <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, and other things like a collection of <a href="subpages.html">subpages</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/rohans1029/Rohan-s-Notes-4d9b7c27e485441296d261bde6e26fe8" target="_BLANK">notes</a>, and a <a href="https://rosikand.github.io/blog/">blog</a>. I am from New Jersey and attend college in California. My primary interests, and hence, my work, lies within machine learning and, more broadly, computer science. In my free time, I enjoy playing spikeball, golfing, and serving ping pong balls.
