# Personal Website 

This repository houses the source code for my personal website linked at, https://rosikand.github.io/. 

The site is hosted using Github Pages and built with Jekyll using the Minima theme. A direct clone of the [Minima source](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) was modified to create this site. 


## To-do 

Some notes to myself: 

- Edit footer 
- Modify the *design* if you could figure that out. Maybe look at the CSS files. 
- Transfer blog posts from previous blog to this blog stream. 
- Transfer rest of pages from previous sites to this one (e.g. the "research" page). 

Low priority: 
- Add analytics 
- Add favicon
