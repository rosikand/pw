I am broadly interesting in how we can create intelligent agents and apply them to real-world problems. Most of my research consists of applying machine learning methods to applications such as healthcare. 

Here is a block of HTML:

      <td>

                                Registration of the T2 and DWI b1200 MRI Sequences of the Prostate</a><br>
                                      Participated in the Canary CREST research program at Stanford Medicine (Urologic Cancer Innovation Lab). There, I conducted a research project involving the registration of the T2 and DWI b1200 MRI Sequences of the Prostate using classical and deep learning methods.
